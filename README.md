# Midterm-Exam-2

For this midterm exam, we were tasked with analyzing global trends in milk production, and consumption, as well as to explore the different aspects of Taylor Swift's music and how they impact listening. 

In looking at the global trends, I chose to section the data by continent, rather than zoning in on a specific continent. This allowed me to look at data that was truly global, and allowed me many routes of how to divide and process the information given to us. I chose to create maps to track the highest and lowest years of both production and consumption, as well as including line charts to more clearly show how the rates of production/consumption changed over time. This information allows us to reflect on how each continent is contributing to and depleting our resources, as well as opening the door to do further analysis about how to stabilize or change these trends moving forward.

In both 1961 and 2022, the America's are the worlds largest consumers of milk, but not the largest producers. You can see how the global role being played by each continent changes over time, besides that Africa is not only the lowest producer of milk, but also the lowest consumer. In around 1990, Asia started to rapidly climb the global ladder in production, and comparitively only increased their consumption slightly. Oceania has dropped substantially in their consumption rates, but simultaneously was increasing their production. Understanding global trends is important to relate to and engage meaningfully with the world and people around us. 


As for the Taylor Swift task, I chose to focus on her albums 1989 and Midnights. Overall, these are two of her more vibrant and happy albums, which are also two of my favorites. In addition to simply finding the sentiments of her lyrics, I wanted to compare how the sentiments of the albums compared, and how (or if) the sentimentality of her albums impacted other aspects of her listening quality, such as danceability, energy, loudness, and instrumentalness. I was unsurprised to find that each of the songs from these albums has a net positive sentiment. Because of that, there is more room to continue comparisons throughout her music library to gain more understanding of what aspects of her music impact the listeners most.
